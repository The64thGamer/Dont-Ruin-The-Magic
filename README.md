# Dont-Ruin-The-Magic
DRTM is a horror-survival game set with unique enemy detection and upgrade systems. The game was never finished, and its being released here for others to play and look around.


A full writeup on the game is available here:
https://minmax.miraheze.org/wiki/Don%27t_Ruin_the_Magic
The game's successor, Min-Max, is currently being worked on in another repository.


# ***NOTE!!!***
There are two major commits to consider, the "October Patch" commit provides the last version of the game before it was dropped for Min-Max.
The current commit, "V2", changes the codebase and levels as an intermediary prototype between the two games, before it was ultimately decided to drop the codebase and start a new one for Min-Max.
You may want to download the October commit instead of the V2 commit for the proper experience.

# ***ALSO!!!***
There are four archived builds in the Assets/Builds folder. None of these are of the "V2" commit, but are of the October and May commits.
